## 🔧 Project Summary

This is a **mobile automation framework** built using **Python**, **Appium**, and **Behave (BDD)** to test the **Wikipedia Android app**.  
It automates **search functionality** using real and emulated devices via Android Studio.

The code is organized using the **Page Object Model (POM)** for reusability and scalability.  
All UI elements are dynamically located using **Appium Inspector**, and test flows are written in **Gherkin syntax**.
