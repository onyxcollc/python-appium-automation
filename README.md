## 🔧 Project Summary

This is a **mobile automation framework** built using **Python**, **Appium**, and **Behave (BDD)** to test the **Wikipedia Android app**.  
It automates **search functionality** using real and emulated devices via Android Studio.

The code is organized using the **Page Object Model (POM)** for reusability and scalability.  
All UI elements are dynamically located using **Appium Inspector**, and test flows are written in **Gherkin syntax**.

## ✅ What I Accomplished

- ✅ Built a complete mobile automation framework using **Python + Appium + Behave**
- ✅ Successfully tested the **search functionality** of the **Wikipedia app**
- ✅ Designed dynamic and reusable **Page Objects**
- ✅ Wrote **BDD Gherkin scenarios** for clear test documentation
- ✅ Practiced using **Appium Inspector** for accurate mobile element location
- ✅ Executed tests on **real and emulated Android devices**

<summary>🧪 Sample Gherkin Scenario</summary>

```gherkin
Feature: Wikipedia search functionality

  Scenario: User can search on Wikipedia
    Given Click to Skip onboarding
    When Click Search icon
    And Search for "Python (programming language)"
    Then Verify first result is "Python (programming language)"

📸 Screenshots
Screenshots are saved automatically to the /screenshots/ directory after each test run.


📌 Note:

Appium sessions are managed before and after each scenario using environment.py

Locators and actions are modular and reusable across the app
