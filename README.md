📱 Python-Appium-Automation
This project is a mobile test automation framework designed for testing native Android applications, specifically demonstrated using the Wikipedia Android app.

🔍 What I Did
I successfully tested the search functionality of the Wikipedia app by developing automated test cases that validated user interactions, navigation, and search behavior within the app.

🚀 Key Features
Python + Appium based mobile automation framework

BDD with Behave for readable and collaborative test cases using Gherkin syntax

Page Object Model (POM) structure for scalable and maintainable code

Executed tests on real and emulated Android devices via Android Studio

Used Appium Inspector for identifying and validating mobile UI elements

Implemented reusable components for UI actions and validations

Validated:

Login flows

UI interactions (e.g., clicking, typing, swiping)

Navigation between native screens

Functional behavior of the search feature in Wikipedia

🧪 Technologies Used
Python

Appium

Behave (BDD)

Android Studio (Device Manager, Emulator)

Appium Inspector
